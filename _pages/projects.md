My work is based on analysis data for actionable insights. Devising and applying models and algorithms to mine the stores of big data. Analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends.

## Cloud Solutions
I develop advanced cloud-based solutions and migrate existing workloads to the cloud.
##  Cloud Data Science
 I am interested in the analysis of data to make predictions in the sector of the Industry and Science, such in Data Science and develop algorithms in Machine Learning.
## HPC CUDA Developments
I was part of developing software in CUDA language that can be used in clusters to perform heavy calculations.

## NUMEN experiment
I am part of the experimental NUMEN collaboration. In the NUMEN project, nuclear reactions of double charge-exchange (DCE) will be used as a tool to extract information on the ββ nuclear matrix elements (NME). Nuclear matrix elements for neutrinoless double beta decay and double charge exchange in the scheme of microscopic Interacting Boson Model are important allowing me belong to the NUMEN collaboration.
My research
provides insights to compute accurate nuclear matrix elements that serve to improve the
nuclear reactions calculations that can be compared with the current experimental data.
By using machine learning techniques, such as regression and classification techniques it was
possible develop an accurate method to fit parameters to construct the nuclear wave
functions for complex nuclei allowing present the results by using plots in Python or R, which
helps to understand the complex quantum structure of the nuclei.

The implementation of new technologies is part of the aim of my future work



# Virial Expansion of Nuclear Equation

Texas A&M University and Cyclotron Institute

College Station, Texas (United States) 

Programming Language: Python with Mathematica

I have developed a **model** to study the transition between mater and plasma. This may help to understand the external conditions of nature to materialize the matter. This provides insight into how was created our universe in terms of thermodynamics. I have proposed a function in terms of energy and with my team, we expanded the energy per particle (E/A) of symmetric infinite nuclear matter in powers of the density to take into account 2, 3, . . . , N-body forces.

Here we have used a **Machine Learning** technique of **Regression** in Python and used it in Mathematica to check our results. 

The new model is proposed by fitting ground state properties of nuclear matter (binding energy, compressibility, and pressure) and assuming that at high densities a second-order phase transition to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) occurs. 

This work helped to understand the nature of the nuclear matter and research more interesting properties of the plasma such are the sun and how under certain conditions the matter if created.
