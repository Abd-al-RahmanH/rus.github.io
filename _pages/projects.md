My work is based on analysis data for actionable insights. Devising and applying models and algorithms to mine the stores of big data. Analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends.

## Cloud Solutions
I develop advanced cloud-based solutions and migrate existing workloads to the cloud.
##  Cloud Data Science
 I am interested in the analysis of data to make predictions in the sector of the Industry and Science, such in Data Science and develop algorithms in Machine Learning.
## HPC CUDA Developments
I was part of developing software in CUDA language that can be used in clusters to perform heavy calculations.

## NUMEN experiment
I am part of the experimental NUMEN collaboration. In the NUMEN project, nuclear reactions of double charge-exchange (DCE) will be used as a tool to extract information on the ββ nuclear matrix elements (NME). Nuclear matrix elements for neutrinoless double beta decay and double charge exchange in the scheme of microscopic Interacting Boson Model are important allowing me belong to the NUMEN collaboration.
My research
provides insights to compute accurate nuclear matrix elements that serve to improve the
nuclear reactions calculations that can be compared with the current experimental data.
By using machine learning techniques, such as regression and classification techniques it was
possible develop an accurate method to fit parameters to construct the nuclear wave
functions for complex nuclei allowing present the results by using plots in Python or R, which
helps to understand the complex quantum structure of the nuclei.

The implementation of new technologies is part of the aim of my future work
