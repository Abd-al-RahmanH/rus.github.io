# Hi there! I'm Ruslan Magana Vsevolodovna

I'm  a **Data Scientist**, a **Cloud Architect** and a **Physicist**.

## About me

I am Data Scientist specializing in  Artificial Intelligence, with a distinct focus on Neural Networks. My core expertise lies in Generative AI and prompt engineering. I possess a strong commitment to precision and boast an extensive track record across diverse domains, including Data Extraction, Statistical Modeling, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, and Infrastructure Cloud Deployment. Proficient in Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and Generative AI, I consistently seek opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible in this ever-evolving landscape.

At present, I serve as a Data Scientist specialized in Artificial Intelligence at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/it-it), where I continue to explore and innovate in the AI domain. My journey has also taken me through pivotal roles as a Data Scientist and Data Engineer at [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/) and as a Data Engineer at [Reply](https://www.reply.com/it/topics/big-data-and-analytics/). Prior to these endeavors, I dedicated my time as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) in Genova, Italy. Here, I was deeply engaged in the development of theoretical models for nuclear research, contributing significantly to the creation of libraries and tools vital for the Nuclear Physics Community.

My professional journey has always been marked by an unwavering commitment to delivering top-tier computational solutions for nuclear physics, while also sharing my enthusiasm for emerging technologies, particularly Machine Learning, with my colleagues. For a comprehensive overview of my career and achievements, please feel free to explore my curriculum vitae [here](https://cloud-data-science.com/).

Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of data science, AI, and technology!

## Data Scientist  & Cloud Architect 

My professional background includes crafting algorithms, making use of machine learning to mine, make sense of data, and using data visualization to present it to decision-makers. I am instrumental in analyzing and delivering quantitative and qualitative research based solutions that reduce redundancy, improve accuracy and efficiency, and achieve organizational objectives. 

I have the ability to expand existing data delivery platforms and creating data systems that optimize data management, capturing, and quality. 

Please feel free to contact me at [contact@ruslanmv.com](mailto:contact@ruslanmv.com) with any thoughts, comments, or questions about my work — I’m always interested in making new professional acquaintances.  You can checkout some of  the projects that I have at [Github](https://github.com/ruslanmv?tab=repositories)  in addition you can visit  [Cloud-Data-Science.com](https://cloud-data-science.com/index.php/services/).

## Free time

In my free time, I like to  be with my family around and visit new places. I like also have discussions about the culture of each new place I  visit. Learn new languages and discover new people. I'm also in love to write topics about **Data Science** and **Data Engineering** Check out  [my Blog! ](https://ruslanmv.com/blog) 

I like open source projects    [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>  Github profile](https://github.com/ruslanmv) to see my projects and get in touch!
