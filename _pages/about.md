# Hi there! I'm Ruslan Magana Vsevolodovna

I'm a **Cloud Architect** a **Data Scientist** and a **Physicist**.

## Scientifical  studies

I am a self-motivated and ambitious data scientist with specialised knowledge in database applications analyses, data analyses. and reports generation to propel project success.

I'm working as Postdoctoral Researcher at National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) at Genova [INFN](https://www.ge.infn.it) developing theoretical models for nuclear research.  My main role is to develop libraries and tool for the Nuclear Physicist Community. I belong to the NUMEN collaboration, and I am  committed to provide high quality computations for nuclear physics,  and I love to engage my colleagues into new technologies such as Machine Learning.

## Cloud Architect  & Data Scientist



My professional background includes crafting algorithms, making use of machine learning to mine, make sense of data, and using data visualization to present it to decision-makers. I am instrumental in analysing and delivering quantitative and qualitative research based solutions that reduce redundancy, improve accuracy and efficiency, and achieve organisational objectives. 

I have the ability to expand existing data delivery platforms and creating data systems that optimise data management, capturing, and quality. 

Please feel free to contact me at contact@ruslanmv.com with any thoughts, comments, or questions about my work—I’m always interested in making new professional acquaintances.

You can checkout some of  the services that I am able to do  [Cloud-Data-Science.com](https://cloud-data-science.com/index.php/services/).



## Free time

In my free time, I like to  be with my family around and visit new places, watch videos in Youtube. I like also
have discussions about the culture of each new place we visit. Learn new languages and discover new people.

I'm also in love with open source. Checkout my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>  Github profile](https://github.com/ruslanmv) to see my projects and get in touch!
