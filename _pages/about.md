# Hi there! I'm Ruslan Magana Vsevolodovna

I'm a **Cloud Architect** a **Data Scientist** and a **Physicist**.

## Scientifical  studies

I'm working as Postdoctoral Researcher at National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN)
Genova [INFN](www.ge.infn.it/){:class="external"},
developing theoretical models for nuclear research.
 My main role is to develop libraries and tool for the Nuclear Physicist Community. I belong to the NUMEN collaboration, and I am  committed to provide high quality computations for nuclear physics,  and I love to engage my colleagues into new technologies such as Machine Learning.



I'm also in love with open source. Checkout my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>  Github profile](https://github.com/ruslanmv) to see my projects and get in touch!

## Cloud Architect  & Data Scientist

I like  to create and develop Cloud
Architectures for the  science and industry.

I really enjoy connecting ideas of Machine Learning to Cloud technologies, and I  like to perform Data Analysis and find trends.




I also really enjoy public speaking and sharing my experiences. You can checkout some of my slides and videos in the [talks page](/talks). Are you looking for speakers?

## Free time



In my free time, I like to  be with my family around and visit new places. I like also
have discussions about the culture of each new place we visit. Lear new languages and discover new people.
