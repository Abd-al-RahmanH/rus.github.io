# Hi there! I'm Ruslan Magana Vsevolodovna

I'm a **Cloud Architect** a **Data Scientist** and a **Physicist**.

## Scientifical  studies

I am a self-motivated and ambitious data scientist with specialised knowledge in database applications analyses, data analyses and reports generation to propel project success.

I am Data Scientist and Data Engineer at [ISCS](https://iscsconsulting.com/company/)  for  [Reply](https://www.reply.com/it/topics/big-data-and-analytics/)  I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) at Genova [INFN](https://www.ge.infn.it) developing theoretical models for nuclear research.  My main role was to develop libraries and tools for the Nuclear Physics Community. 

I  was committed to provide high quality computations for nuclear physics,  and I love to engage my colleagues into new technologies such as Machine Learning. Checkout my curriculum vitae [here](https://cloud-data-science.com/).

## Cloud Architect  & Data Scientist



My professional background includes crafting algorithms, making use of machine learning to mine, make sense of data, and using data visualization to present it to decision-makers. I am instrumental in analyzing and delivering quantitative and qualitative research based solutions that reduce redundancy, improve accuracy and efficiency, and achieve organizational objectives. 

I have the ability to expand existing data delivery platforms and creating data systems that optimize data management, capturing, and quality. 

Please feel free to contact me at [contact@ruslanmv.com](mailto:contact@ruslanmv.com) with any thoughts, comments, or questions about my work—I’m always interested in making new professional acquaintances.  You can checkout some of  the projects that I have  [https://stackmuncher.com/ruslanmv](https://stackmuncher.com/ruslanmv )  in addition you can visit  [Cloud-Data-Science.com](https://cloud-data-science.com/index.php/services/).



## Free time

In my free time, I like to  be with my family around and visit new places. I like also have discussions about the culture of each new place I  visit. Learn new languages and discover new people. I'm also in love to write topics about **Data Science** and **Data Engineering** Check out  [my Blog! ](https://ruslanmv.com/blog) 

I like open source projects    [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>  Github profile](https://github.com/ruslanmv) to see my projects and get in touch!
