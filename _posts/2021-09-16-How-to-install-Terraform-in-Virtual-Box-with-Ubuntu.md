If you are working in **Windows**  or **Mac** you  can install **VirtualBox 6.1.22** otherwise you can skip the following step.

If you have all the prerequisites mentioned before go to the step 5 to start coding =).

# Section 1. Ubuntu as a virtual machine on Windows

To install Ubuntu as a virtual machine on Windows 10:

1. [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for Windows and install it on your computer. 

   <img src="../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/0.jpg" style="zoom:50%;" />

2. Download the Ubuntu ISO file you want to install from the [Ubuntu download page](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

1. Open VirtualBox and select **New** in the top taskbar.

2. Give your VM a name, choose **Linux** as the **Type**, then choose **Ubuntu** as the **Version** and select **Next**.

3. Choose how much RAM you want to assign to the virtual machine and select **Next**. The recommended minimum is 1024  MB .  I will use **4096 MB**

   The amount of memory you set aside is only used while the virtual machine is running.

4. Choose **Create a virtual hard disk now** and select **Create**.

   You must create a virtual hard drive to save the changes you make in Ubuntu.

5. Choose **VDI** (VirtualBox Disk Image) and select **Next**.

6. Choose **Dynamically allocated** or **Fixed size** for the storage type and select **Next**.

   A fixed size disk performs better because the virtual machine doesn't have to increase the file size as you install software.

   Choose at least **20GB** of size.

7. The name of your virtual machine will now appear on the left side of the VirtualBox manager. Select **Start** in the toolbar to launch your VM.

8. This is the point where you need to choose the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded earlier.

9. Select **Add** in the window that pops up.

10. Choose your Ubuntu disk image and select **Open**.

11. Select **Choose**.

12. Select **Start**.

13. Your VM will now boot into a live version of Ubuntu. Choose your language and select **Install Ubuntu**.

    If you select **Try Ubuntu**, you can run the installer later by double-clicking **Install Ubuntu** on the desktop.

14. Choose your keyboard layout and select **Continue**.

15. Choose **Normal installation** or **Minimal installation**, then select **Continue**.

    Check the boxes under **Other Options** to download updates.

16. Choose **Erase disk and install Ubuntu** and select **Install Now**, then select **Continue** to ignore the warning.

    This step will not erase your computer's physical hard drive; it only applies to the virtual machine.

17. Choose your time zone on the map, then select **Continue**.

18. Set up your user account, your computer we select `aws` and select **Continue**. 

19. Select **Restart Now** and press enter. After restart you will have something like

20. To enable the shared clipboard in VirtualBox , go to Oracle VM Virtual Box Manager and our image called ubuntu click settings  then General>Advanced>Shared Clipboard we change to **Bidirectional**   and then click **OK**

    ![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/bidi.jpg)

21. Hide the Dock (optional) 

    Due to we will going to code, we need work with a **clean screen.** so Let us to clear the screen in ubuntu by removing the left panel of ubuntu while we are coding.

    Press the **Win key** on your keyboard and type “dock” to filter the app list down to the sub-page you need in “Appearance Settings.” Select the Settings entry that appears to open that page.

    ![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/0c.jpg)

    Enable the toggle next to “Auto-hide the Dock.”

    ![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/0d.jpg)

    

22. Then return back to your terminal in Ubuntu , open a new terminal,

    <img src="../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/0a.jpg" style="zoom:80%;" /> 

23. and type the following

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

    ```
    sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-x11
    ```

    ```
    sudo VBoxClient --clipboard
    ```

    then Shared Clipboard should be work.   Copy the following text

    ```
    echo 'Your VM is Ready!'
    ```

    and paste it with `ctrl` + `shift` +`v`  and then press enter.

    Great, now you have virtual box with Ubuntu **ready to start** your project.

# Section 2. Installation  AWS CLI , Terraform and Terragrunt

First update the package repository cache with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

#### AWS CLI 

Now install **AWS CLI** with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install awscli
```

Now press **y** and then press **Enter** to continue.

Now check whether **AWS CLI** is working with the following command:

```
aws --version
```

you should have something like

```
aws-cli/1.18.69 Python/3.8.5 Linux/5.11.0-38-generic botocore/1.16.19
```

#### Terraform

In this  project we will use the Terraform version 0.13.5

We first need install software-properties-common, gnupg,  and curl packages 

```
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
```

```
sudo apt-get install gnupg
```

```
sudo apt install curl
```

We will verify the HashiCorp's GPG signature, and install HashiCorp's

```shell-session
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
```

Add the HashiCorp [GPG key](https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg).

```shell-session
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add the official HashiCorp Linux repository.

```shell-session
sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
```

Update to add the repository, and install the Terraform CLI.

```shell-session
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform=0.13.5
```



![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/5.jpg)

Verify the installation

```
terraform -help plan
```

![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/6a.jpg)

Additional resource's.(optional)

If you are interested to switch different versions of Terraform, you can install `tfswitch`

```
sudo snap install tfswitch
```



### Terragrunt

[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) is used to work with Terraform configurations which allows to orchestrate dependent layers, update arguments dynamically and keep configurations [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

The officially [supported](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/supported-terraform-versions/) versions are:

| Terraform Version | Terragrunt Version                                           |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.0.x             | >= [0.31.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.31.0) |
| 0.15.x            | >= [0.29.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.29.0) |
| 0.14.x            | >= [0.27.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.27.0) |
| 0.13.x            | >= [0.25.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.25.0) |

In this project we will use Terraform  version **0.13.5** of and  Terragrunt **0.29.4** 

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential procps curl file git
```

then we install **brew**

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

and then press enter ,you will have something like

![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/7.jpg)



then copy the two commands like says in your terminal as example in my case is

```
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/ruslanmv/.profile
```

```
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

then you can test your brew installation by

```
brew help
```

![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/9a.jpg)



and finally we can install Terragrunt.

We are going to us the following package  **tgenv** to switch different versions of terragrunt.

```
git clone https://github.com/cunymatthieu/tgenv.git ~/.tgenv
```

you can make symlinks for `tgenv/bin/*` scripts into a path that is already added to your `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`) `OSX/Linux Only!`

```
sudo ln -s ~/.tgenv/bin/* /usr/local/bin
```

Install a specific version of terragrunt

```
tgenv install 0.29.4
```

 to install latest version

```
tgenv install latest
```

List installed versions

```
tgenv list
```

Switch a version to use `0.29.4` is a syntax to use the latest installed version

```
tgenv use 0.29.4
```

![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/10.jpg)



```
terragrunt --version
```

![](../assets/images/posts/2021-09-16-How-to-install-Terraform-in-Virtual-Box-with-Ubuntu/11.jpg)



```
terraform --version
```

Perfect, now we are ready start  setup the **AWS credentials**.  

# Section 3. Configure access to AWS account

There are several ways to view and set your configuration settings in the files.

- The first method is use **`aws configure`**

  Run this command to quickly set and view your credentials, region, and output format. The following example shows sample values.

```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

- The second method is by using **Credentials and config file**.

  Import `CSV` credentials generated from the AWS web console. 

  ```
  aws configure import --csv credentials.csv
  ```

To list all configuration data, use the `aws configure list` command. This command displays the AWS CLI name of all settings you've configured

```
aws configure list
```

You can create s3 bucket and check if you can see it with the command

```
aws s3 ls
```

For Terraform to be able to make changes in your AWS account, you will need to set the AWS credentials for the IAM user you created earlier as the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. 

The recommended way to configure access credentials to AWS account is using environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
```

```
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)
```

```
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

If your are using additional layers of security such as Token, you should also  include it.

```
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=(your token key)
```

Note that these environment variables apply only to the current shell, so if you reboot your computer or open a new terminal window, you’ll need to export these variables again.

Alternatively, you can edit `terragrunt.hcl` and use another authentication mechanism as described in [AWS provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication).

You can use an [AWS credentials or configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to specify your credentials. The default location is `$HOME/.aws/credentials` on Linux and macOS, or `"%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"` on Windows. You can optionally specify a different location in the Terraform configuration by providing the `shared_credentials_file` argument or using the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable. 

Great, now le us install the editor where we can start creating our **infrastructure code**

# Section 4. Install Visual Studio Code

The Visual Studio Code is available from the official Microsoft Apt repositories. 

```
sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget
```

Import the Microsoft GPG key using the following wget command:

```
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
```


And enable the Visual Studio code repository by typing:

```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"
```

Once the apt repository is enabled, install the Visual Studio code package:

```
sudo apt install code
```

First let us create a folder where we will create our project.

```
mkdir project
```

```
cd project
```

VS Code can be launched from the command line by typing

```
code .
```

then click Trust the authors.
