Today I wanted to create a Flask Seaborn Regression Plot by using an app Docker Container



In this blog post, we'll see how to create a Docker Container in Mac OS, and how to use  Docker Container to  Create a Flask Seaborn Regression Plot App

# Flask  Regression with  App Docker Container

Now we will work on Docker Container. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

- Install a Linux image into a docker container.
- Use the Pandas package with Seaborn to create a regression plot.
- Use flask to create a web application that returns a plot.
- Build a requirements document with packages needed for the application.
- Build the application in a container using a Dockerfile and test it.



# Install Docker on your Mac OS using Homebrew

Note that `brew install docker` and `brew cask install docker` is different. Some of the instructions about docker installation on Mac OS use the latter code that installs Docker as an Application,

```unix
$ brew install docker docker-machine
$ brew cask install virtualbox
-> need password
-> possibly need to address System Preference setting
$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
$ docker-machine env default
$ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"

```

Notice: that if the deamon of the docker is stopped you can start it  with the command

$ docker-machine start default

After installation, add yourself to the docker group, otherwise use sudo for commands.



We check if the installation of the docker is correct

$ docker run hello-world

Here, you are added to the docker group

Start a Docker container with a Linux Image.

$docker run python:3.8



Use Docker command ps-a to view containers.

To list all running Docker containers, enter the following into a terminal window:

```unix
docker ps â€“a
```

Enter a Container Linux environment in a bash shell.

`$docker run -it python:3.8 bash `

`pip3 install flask`

`exit`

Run and remove a named container.

`docker ps -a`

To immediately **remove** a docker container without waiting for the grace period to end use:

```output
docker rm  container_id
```

## 

To create a new container from an image and start it, use **`docker run`**:

```unix
docker run --name myContainer python:3.8
```

and remove

`docker rm myContainer `

Congratulations! now that you have created your first container with unix, we will create the application 

to add to the docker container.



## Use the Pandas package with Seaborn to create a regression plot

Create a Pandas Dataframe

Create a Seaborn regression plot to show possible correlation.

Save the file locally to verify code.

Return the data file.



## Use flask to create a web application that returns a plot.

Import objects and methods to create a flask application.

Use the regression plot to get an image.

Return the image to the browser window.

Run the application and browse to localhost:5000

## Build a requirements document with packages needed for the application.

Create a file called requirements.txt

Determine the versions of packages needed for the application.

pip freeze | grep pandas

pip freeze | grep matplotlib

pip freeze | grep seaborn

 pip freeze | grep matplotlib

python

import flask

flask.__ version __





Add the packages and versions to the requirements.txt.

Create a Dockerfile for use in the next task

## Build the application in a container using a Dockerfile and test it.

Load the base image.

Copy the requirements doc to the container. 

Identify the working directory in the container image.

Identify the port to run on.

Create the command to run the app.

docker build --tag flask-plotting-app .

run -i -t --name flaskpltapp -p5000:5000 flask-plotting-app:latest
