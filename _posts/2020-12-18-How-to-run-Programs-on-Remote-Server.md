 How to run a  FORTRAN,  program within Python from  Jupyter Notebooks on remote server with SSH?

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.

If want to run your old program  FORTRAN code or  C code  within on a remote server without root priviliges in a  Jupyter notebooks . In this post, I will show   to accomplish this. In short, there are  many  ways to access Jupyter Notebooks running on remote server.   We will follow the safest method  by using SSH Tunneling. If you are working on a compute server which runs a linux. The machine is used by several users  and you   don't have and won't get root privileges. And you need  need to install `Keras` which you would normally do by using `pip` , as you know , pip is not installed and the `root` won't install it for us.  Lets try  how  to make an installation of pip that does not try to touch anything outside my local directory.

## Access Server using SSH

Using SSH is the recommended method since it is more secure and easier to setup.  As you may or may not know, when you connect to your remote server and you get the shell access, it is done through ssh. There are two ways general ways to authenticate with the remote server —

- Using password
- Using Pub/Priv Keys

Suppose you have a system on a local or remote network with IP `xx.xx.xx.xx` and you want to connect to it using ssh, the way you do it depends on whether you’re on windows or unix system.

On Unix, you might do something like `ssh username@xx.xx.xx.xx` and then you have to enter a password (password authentication) or you use your private key (which is the more secure method)

 As long as you can connect to your system using SSH, you can run the jupyter notebook there and access it remotely. How? By using SSH Tunneling.

##  SSH Tunneling

This is also known as port forwarding. What this means is that you setup a network tunnel (a connection for data to flow) from a local point to remote point.

Example: `ssh username@xx.xx.xx.xx -NL 1234:localhost:1234` (for Unix)

Look at the above example, `1234:localhost:1234` is the important part. What does it mean? It means that any network request you send to port `1234` in your current system will be automatically forwarded to `localhost:1234` *from the remote system*.

You might have gotten some inkling on how it is possible to use SSH tunneling to access jupyter notebook from the above diagram. Let’s make it clear.

## Anaconda Installation in the Server

The first step is enter to the server via ssh 

```
ssh username@xx.xx.xx.xx
```

where user is your username and xx.xx.xx.xx is your ip or domain of your remote server.

Next step, is create a folder where you will install your  anaconda.

for example

```
mkdir /project/teo/username/
cd  /project/teo/username/
```

Then you can download Anaconda file from this [page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) using `wget`. You will happily find the file to be a `.sh` file.

Use the following command to install Anaconda (for Python3):

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

and later you install

```
 bash ./Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

then you accep the licesense terms yes

and when it will be asked for the location 

"Anaconda3 will now be installed into this location":

you write the  address

```
/project/teo/username/anaconda3
```

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 14.35.22](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2014.35.22-8410953.png)

then you select initialize conda with yes

Finally you got

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 14.36.06](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2014.36.06-8410953.png)



The next step is add the route to  your bash



```
 export PATH="/project/teo/username/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
```

then you check if is installed

```
$conda --version

conda 4.9.2

```

and you check jupyter

```
$jupyter --version

jupyter core     : 4.6.3
jupyter-notebook : 6.1.4
qtconsole        : 4.7.7
ipython          : 7.19.0
ipykernel        : 5.3.4
jupyter client   : 6.1.7
jupyter lab      : 2.2.6
nbconvert        : 6.0.7
ipywidgets       : 7.5.1
nbformat         : 5.0.8
traitlets        : 5.0.5

```

Great now you have installed Jupyter!!!

#### Conda Activation (Optional)

In such case you forget  to  activate conda you can activate. Manually adding Conda on `$PATH` is no longer recommended as of v4.4.0 (see [Release Notes](https://github.com/conda/conda/releases/tag/4.4.0)). Furthermore, since [Conda v4.6](https://github.com/conda/conda/releases/tag/4.6.0) new functionality to manage shell initialization via the `conda init` command was introduced. Hence, the updated recommendation is to run

```
./project/teo/username/anaconda3/bin/conda init
```

otherwise the manual form you can  see the solution in  [asubuntu.com](https://askubuntu.com/questions/849470/how-do-i-activate-a-conda-environment-in-my-bashrc) or in [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18675907/how-to-run-conda).

## Installation of Libraries for Python in your Server

You need  need to install `Keras` which you would normally do by using `pip` , as you know , pip is not installed and the `root` .

So you can do this:

Use the following command to install other *software* (SOFTWARE_NAME) by pip:

```py
anaconda3/bin/pip install SOFTWARE_NAME
```

In this case 

```
pip install keras
```

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 15.07.58](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2015.07.58-8410953.png)



Now we have succesfully installed all our libraries needed in our anaconda server.



## Access Jupyter Notebook



First, make sure you install Jupyter notebook in both remote (working station in your offcie) and local (your home computer).

Whenever you start jupyter notebook, you can access it by going to `localhost:8888` in your browser. But that works because the jupyter is running on *your* `localhost` . What about when the jupyter is running on someone else’s (remote server’s) `localhost` .

So what you need is a way to connect to the remote server’s `localhost`from your local computer. That’s where SSH Tunneling comes into play.

Suppose your server’s IP is `172.26.36.128` as an example. You get shell access to your server using ssh (using any of your preferred method). Then you start the jupyter notebook —



On remote host, open the terminal, change directory to where you have your notebooks and type:

```
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8889
```

This will start the jupyter notebook on port `8889` . You will also get a URL with authentication token —

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 15.35.04](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2015.35.04-8410953.png)

You copy your token, in my case is:

```
ef13dc25b1ce0948a06476de07d86b6258d1e255da53abb7
```

In your local computer,  to start SSH tunneling on unix, open your terminal and enter the following command

```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8887:localhost:8889 username@172.26.36.128
```

Now open web browser (google chrome, firefox, ...) and type:

```
localhost:8887
# you will see your Jupyter notebooks asking for a password token
```

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 15.56.44](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2015.56.44-8410953.png)

Then copy the token  and paste it and login

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 16.01.34](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2016.01.34-8410953.png)

You will see the Jupyter Notebook running in your browser while the code in the notebook is executed on the remote server. That’s all!



## Run Fortran  Code in Jupyter notebook



There are several ways to run a Fortran code in Jupyter notebook , let us just show two ways.

1. f2py
2. By using the terminal



The purpose of the F2PY –Fortran to Python interface generator– is to provide a connection between Python and Fortran languages. F2PY is a part of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (`numpy.f2py`) and also available as a standalone command line tool f2py when numpy is installed that facilitates creating/building Python C/API extension modules that make it possible

- to call Fortran 77/90/95 external subroutines and Fortran 90/95 module subroutines as well as C functions;
- to access Fortran 77 COMMON blocks and Fortran 90/95 module data, including allocatable arrays.

Check out [F2PY's user guide](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/f2py/) for a more complete reference and installation procedures. From the documentation:

## a) F2PY 

F2PY works by creating an extension module that can be imported in Python using the `import` keyword. The module contains automatically generated wrapper functions that can be called from Python, acting as an interface between Python and the compiled Fortran routines

 First, F2PY reads the Fortran source file and creates a so-called signature file that contains all the necessary information about the Fortran routines needed to make the wrapper functions. The signature file is then read and the source code of the extension module is generated in C, using the Python C API. In the last step, F2PY compiles all the source code and builds the extension module containing the wrappers and the compiled Fortran routines.

Consider a Fortran 77 file `ftype.f`:

Let us copy the following code:

```
C FILE: FTYPE.F
      SUBROUTINE FOO(N)
      INTEGER N
Cf2py integer optional,intent(in) :: n = 13
      REAL A,X
      COMMON /DATA/ A,X(3)
      PRINT*, "IN FOO: N=",N," A=",A," X=[",X(1),X(2),X(3),"]"
      END
C END OF FTYPE.F
```

we open a text file in jupyter

We paste it and we rename

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 16.19.43](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2016.19.43-8410953.png)



and we have the Fortran code here

We  open a new Terminal in jupyter

and build a wrapper using `f2py -c ftype.f -m ftype`

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 17.14.29](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2017.14.29-8410953.png)





We create a new jupyter noteebok with python3

![Screenshot 2020-12-16 at 16.22.41](../assets/images/posts/2020-12-18-How-to-run-Programs-on-Remote-Server/Screenshot%202020-12-16%20at%2016.22.41-8410953.png)

Check out [More examples ](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/python-usage.html#string-arguments) for a more complete reference .



## b) By using the terminal

This is the simples way to run any executable code in a server and stupid, but under situations that there is no way, or time to compile your programs

and your need finish any work on time. Try use this method.

```
#this code can be run using os:
import os
os.system('cmd command')# you can execute any FORTRAN or C compiled program :))
```



## Install Tensorflow in a VAX machine

If you dont have root credentials its a bit hard to compile Tensorflow , because you need to install bazel and Tensorflow source and compile them by using the appropiate version of gcc, if you dont have the control of that is a a really mess.  So there is a trick that fortunatelly worked  to me.

```
conda --version
```

```
conda 4.9.2
```

```
$conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow

```



```

## Conclusion

This is how you access jupyter notebook from a remote server. Some additional things you can do is run the SSH Tunnel command and Jupyter notebook command in the background. So you can have a jupyter notebook perpetually running on some dedicated port.

Thank you for reading!

**Congratulation** we have  created  SSH Tunnel within Jupiter Notebook compatible with Tensorflow, Keras and Fortran 77.
