Hello everyone, today we are going to practice some  Azure Data Science Questions. In the following sections we are going to answer several questions that are important in Data Science projects in the IT industry by using
Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.

We have spited the questions and answers into six parts:[ 1 ](#part-1),   [ 2 ](#part-2),   [ 3 ](#part-3),   [ 4 ](#part-4),   [ 5 ](#part-5),   [ 6 ](#part-6).

    1. Add the Partition and Sample module to your experiment in Studio,  and connect the dataset.

    2. Partition or sample mode: Set this to Sampling.
    3. Rate of sampling. Random seed for sampling.

    ```
    import azureml.core
    from azure.core import Workspace, Datastore
    ws = Workspace.from_config()
    datastore= Datastore.get(ws,'demo_datastore')

    ### d) Which  module should use under the scenario to remove potential duplicates from a dataset?

    Remove Duplicate Rows

28. ### You need to normalize values to produce a feature column grouped into bins. What you should do?

    Apply an Entropy Minimum Description Length (MDL) binning mode.

    This method requires that you select the column you want to predict and the column or columns that you want to group into bins. It then makes a pass over the data and attempts to determine the number of bins that minimizes the entropy. In other words, it chooses a number of bins that allows the data column to best predict the target column.

30. ### You need to normalize values to produce an output column into bins to predict a target column. What you should do?

    Use the Entropy MDL binning mode which has a target column.

31. ### One class has a much smaller number of observations than the other classes in the training set.

    You need to select an appropriate data sampling strategy to compensate for the class imbalance. What you should do?
    Use the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling mode. SMOTE is used to increase the number of underepresented cases in a dataset used for machine learning. SMOTE is a better way of increasing the number of rare cases than simply duplicating existing cases.

32. ### You need to generate a statistical summary that contains the p-value and the unique count for each feature column. What you should do?

    Export Count Table and Summarize Data

    The Export Count Table module is provided for backward compatibility with experiments that use the Build Count Table (deprecated) and Count Featurizer (deprecated) modules.
     Summarize Data statistics are useful when you want to understand the characteristics of the complete dataset.

33. ### You are analyzing a numerical dataset which contains missing values in several columns. You must clean the missing values using an appropriate operation without affecting the dimensionality of the feature set.  What you should do?

    Replace using MICE: For each missing value, this option assigns a new value, which is calculated by using a method described in the statistical literature as "Multivariate Imputation using Chained Equations" or "Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations". With a multiple imputation method, each variable with missing data is modeled conditionally using the other variables in the data before filling in the missing values.

33. ### You are building a regression model using the scikit-learn Python package. You need to transform the text data to be compatible with the scikit-learn Python package. What you should do?

    - Use Pandas. Pandas takes data (like a CSV or TSV file, or a SQL database) and creates a Python object with rows and columns called data frame that looks very similar to table in a statistical software (think Excel or SPSS for example
    - And use  transpose. Reshape the data from the pandas Series to columns.

 {:start="34"}

34. ### Which Azure tool should you use to run Python-based data visualization code?

â€‹	 Azure Notebooks

{:start="36"}

36. ### You must clean the missing values using an appropriate operation without affecting the dimensionality of the feature set. You need to analyze a full dataset to include all values.

    Replace using MICE: For each missing value, this option assigns a new value, which is calculated by using a method described in the statistical literature as "Multivariate Imputation using Chained Equations" or "Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations". 

    With a multiple imputation method, each variable with missing data is modeled conditionally using the other variables in the data before filling in the missing values.

    Note: Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), sometimes called fully conditional specification   or  sequential regression multiple imputation   has emerged in the statistical literature as one principled method of addressing missing data. Creating multiple imputations, as opposed to single imputations, accounts for the statistical uncertainty in the imputations. In addition, the chained equations approach is very flexible and can handle variables of varying types
    (e.g., continuous or binary) as well as complexities such as bounds or survey skip patterns.

{:start="38"}
38. ### You have a small dataset that has missing values in many columns. The data does not require the application of predictors for each column. You will use the Clean Missing Data. Which method should you use?

    Replace using Probabilistic PCA: Compared to other options, such as Multiple Imputation using Chained Equations (MICE), this option has the advantage of not requiring the application of predictors for each column.
	Instead, it approximates the covariance for the full dataset. 
	Therefore, it might offer better performance for datasets that have missing values in many columns.

39. ### You need to divide data into two distinct datasets with  Azure Machine Learning Studio.
    Which module should you use?

    The Group Data into Bins module supports multiple options for binning data. You can customize how the bin edges are set and how values are apportioned into the bins

40. ### You need to access photograph files in the Azure blob container from the Azure Machine Learning service workspace that will be used for deep learning model training. You must minimize data movement.
    What should you do?

    Create a datastore for an Azure Blob container. When you create a workspace, an Azure blob container and an Azure file share are automatically registered to the workspace.

41. ### You must clean the missing values using an appropriate operation without affecting the dimensionality of the feature set. You need to analyze a full dataset to include all values. What you should do?

    Use the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) method.

42. ### How you should write a  custom role can do everything in the workspace except for the following actions:

    It can't create or update a compute resource.
    It can't delete a compute resource.
    It can't add, delete, or alter role assignments.
    It can't delete the workspace.

    ```
    {
       "Name":"Data Scientist Custom",
       "IsCustom":true,
       "Description":"Can run experiment but can't create or delete compute.",
       "Actions":[
          "*"
       ],
       "NotActions":[
          "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/delete",
          "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/write",
          "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/write",
          "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/delete",
          "Microsoft.Authorization/*/write"
       ],
    ```


43. ### You need to normalize values to produce an output column into bins to predict a target column. What you should do?

    Use the Entropy MDL binning mode which has a target column.

{:start="45"}
45. ### You must generate a k-fold algorithm implantation in the Python Scikit-learn machine learning library: and you need to implement a cross-validation to generate the output. How you should do that

    Example

    ```
    from numpy import array
    from sklearn.model_selection impot KFold
    X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    kf = KFold(n_splits=2)
    kf.get_n_splits(X)
    print(kf)
    ```

{:start="46"}
46. ### You need to split your dataset into training and testing subsets by using the Split Data module.

    You can use Split Rows: Use this option if you just want to divide the data into two parts.

47. ### You need to specify the compute resources to be used for running the code to submit the experiment, and for running the script in order to minimize model training time.

    The ds-workstation compute instance. A workstation notebook instance is good enough to run experiments. With the gpu-cluster compute target.

48. ### Which parameters must you add to the config.json file in order to connect to the workspace?

    resource_group

    subscription_id

    ml-workspace

49. ### You need to split the data with a 0.75:0.25 ratio. Which value should you use for each parameter?

68. ###  You plan to aggregate data for all of the TSV files together and then register the aggregated data as a dataset in an Azure.    What elements are FileDataset references  and  path and TabularDataset.to_pandas_dataframe?

    FileDataset references single or multiple files in datastores or from public URLs.
    The TSV files need to be parsed.

    to_path() gets a list of file paths for each file stream defined by the dataset.

    TabularDataset.to_pandas_dataframe loads all records from the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
    
    TabularDataset represents data in a tabular format created by parsing the provided file or list of files.

{:start="69"}
69. ###  You need to obtain the output from the pipeline execution. Where will you find the output?

    A file named parallel_run_step.txt located in the output folder

    Step 1: Publish the pipeline.
    To schedule a pipeline, you'll need a reference to your workspace, the identifier of your published pipeline, and the name of the experiment in which you wish to create the schedule.
    
    Step 2: Retrieve the pipeline ID.
    Needed for the schedule.
    
    Step 3: Create a ScheduleRecurrence..


71. ### You create a script for training a machine learning model in Azure Machine Learning service. What is Parameter source_directory,  script_params and the conda_packages ?

    run.log('row_count', rows)

77. ###  You need to select an appropriate data sampling strategy to compensate for the class imbalance.
    You use the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling mode.

78. ###  You need to identify outliers in the data. Which two visualizations can you use?
    Box plot

    Scatter plot

    

79. ###  You are evaluating a completed binary classification machine learning model. You need to use the precision as the evaluation metric.
    Binary classification confusion matrix

80. ###  You need to define a primary metric to determine the hyperparameter values that result in the model with the best accuracy score

    Set the primary_metric_goal of the estimator used to run the Â·
    bird_classifier_train.py script to maximize.

    Set the primary_metric_name of the estimator used to run the Â·
    bird_classifier_train.py script to accuracy.

    Add code to the bird_classifier_train.py script to calculate the validation accuracy Â·
    of the model and log it as a float value with the key accuracy.

81. ###  You use the dataset to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary classifier. You need to use the Permutation Feature Importance module in Azure Machine Learning Studio to compute a set of feature importance scores for the dataset.
    Add a Two-Class Support Vector Machine module to initialize the SVM classifier.

    Add a dataset to the experiment

    Add a Split Data module to create training and test dataset. To generate a set of feature scores requires that you have an already trained model, as well as a test dataset.

    Add a Permutation Feature Importance module and connect to the trained model and test dataset.

    Set the Metric for measuring performance property to Classification - Accuracy and then run the experiment.

82. ###  What is random sampling?

    In random sampling, hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space. Random sampling allows the search space to include both discrete and continuous hyperparameters.

83. ###  The dataset contains categorical features that are highly correlated to the output label column.

    Pearson's correlation statistic, or Pearson's correlation coefficient, is also known in statistical models as the r value. For any two variables, it returns a value that indicates the strength of the correlation

84. a) **What is True Positive?**

    A true positive is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class

    b) **What is True Negative?**

    A true negative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class.

    c) **What is False Positive?**

    A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.

    d) **What is  False Negative?**

    A false negative is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class.

85. ### You need to use the param_sampling method of the Python API for the Azure Machine Learning Service. How should you ?

    In random sampling, hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space. Random sampling allows the search space to include both discrete and continuous hyperparameters.
    Example:

    ```
    from azureml.train.hyperdrive import RandomParameterSampling param_sampling = RandomParameterSampling( {
    "learning_rate": **normal**(10, 3),
    "keep_probability": **uniform**(0.05, 0.1),
    "batch_size": **choice**(16, 32, 64)
    }
    ```


{:start="86"}    
86. ### You need to configure automated machine learning to automatically impute missing values and encode categorical features as part of the training task. Which parameter and value pair should you use in the AutoMLConfig class?

87. ### You need to use the designer to create a pipeline that includes steps to perform the following tasks:
    Select the training features using the pandas filter method. Train a model based on the naive_bayes.GaussianNB algorithm.

    Two-Class Neural Network -The Two-Class Neural Network creates a binary classifier using a neural network algorithm.
    Train a model based on the naive_bayes.GaussianNB algorithm.
    
    Execute python script -
    
88. ### You need to determine whether the feature values achieve the conditions to build a Poisson regression model.

    The label data must be whole numbers.

    The label data must be a positive value.

    Poisson regression is intended for use in regression models that are used to predict numeric values, typically counts.

89. ### One class has a much smaller number of observations than the other classes in the training set.
    You need to select an appropriate data sampling strategy to compensate for the class imbalance.

    Use the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling mode.

90. ### You need to add the new feature to the dataset. Which Azure Machine Learning Studio module should you use?

    Typical metadata changes might include marking columns as features.

91. ### You are evaluating a completed binary classification machine learning model. You need to use the precision as the evaluation metric.

    Receiver operating characteristic (or ROC) is a plot of the correctly classified labels vs. the incorrectly classified labels for a particular model.


93. ### You are solving a classification task.
    You must evaluate your model on a limited data sample by using k-fold cross- validation.

    Leave One Out (LOO) cross-validation
    Setting K = n (the number of observations) yields n-fold and is called leave-one out cross-validation (LOO), a special case of the K-fold approach.

94. ### You need to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set to 10 features in both training and testing sets.

    PCA(n_components = 10)
    Need to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set to 10 features in both training and testing sets.
    Example:

    ```
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    pca = PCA(n_components=2) ;2 dimensions
    principalComponents = pca.fit_transform(x)
    ```

    pca fit_transform(X[, y]) fits the model with X and apply the dimensionality reduction on X.
    transform(x_test),transform(X) applies dimensionality reduction to X.

95. ### The Poisson correlation coefficient (r-value) of X, Y, and Z features

    Z,Y  is  is the value  of the correlaiton and is a positively linear relationship
    +1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship -1 indicates a strong negative linear correlation 0 denotes no linear relationship between the two variables.

96. ### You need to use the appropriate logging methods of the experiment's run object to log the required information

    log - log_image - log_table -

97. training_ds = workspace.datasets.get("training_data") You define an estimator to run the script.

    inputs = [training_ds.as_named_input('training_ds')] Â·

98. ###  You need to pass the dataset to ensure that the script can read the files it references.
    Which code segment should you insert to replace the code comment?

    inputs=[file_dataset.as_named_input('training_files').as_mount()], Â·

99. ### You need to ingest the data from the CSV file into the designer pipeline using the minimal administrative effort.

    The preferred way to provide data to a pipeline is a Dataset object.

100. ### You need to load the training data.
     Which code segment should you use?

     data_folder = args.data_folder

     train_data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(data_folder, 'data.csv'))

{:start="101"}
101. ### You need to create a dataset named training_data and load the data from all files into a single data frame

     Use Dataset.Tabular_from_delimeted as the data isn't cleansed.
     

{:start="104"}
104. ### You need to configure the search space for the Hyperdrive experiment. Which two parameter expressions should you use?

     a uniform expression for learning_rate

     a choice expression for batch_size

105. ### You want to use automated machine learning to find the best regression model for predicting the price column.

     - Training_data - The training data to be used within the experiment. It should contain both training features and a label column (optionally a sample weights column). If training_data is specified, then the label_column_name parameter must also be specified.
     
     -  Validation_data - Provide validation data: In this case, you can either start with a single data file and split it into training and validation sets or you can provide a separate data file for the validation set. Either way, the validation_data parameter in your AutoMLConfig object assigns which data to use as your validation set. 
     
       Example, the following code example explicitly defines which portion of the provided data in dataset to use for training and validation. 

       ```
       dataset = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files(data) 
       training_data, validation_data = dataset.random_split(percentage=0.8, seed=1) 
       automl_config = AutoMLConfig(compute_target = aml_remote_compute, task = 'classification', primary_metric = 'AUC_weighted', training_data = training_data, validation_data = validation_data, label_column_name = 'Class' )
       ```
     
     - label_column_name 

{:start="106"}
106. ### What are Hyperparameters in Bayesian Samplig?

     Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters you choose to train a model that govern the training process itself. Azure Machine Learning allows you to automate hyperparameter exploration in an efficient manner, saving you significant time and resources. You specify the range of hyperparameter values and a maximum number of training runs. uniform(low, high) -

     Bayesian sampling does not currently support any early termination policy.

107. ### What is the The last invocation of the automl_classifier returns the best run

     best_run, fitted_model = local_run.get_output()

108. ### You need to ensure that the Automated Machine Learning process evaluates only linear models.

     Clear the option to perform automatic featurization.

     Automatic featurization can fit non-linear models.

109. ### You must add code to the script to record the unique label values as run metrics at the point indicated by the comment.

     label_vals has the unique labels (from the statement label_vals = data['label'].unique()), and it has to be logged.


110. ### Which values should you use in the REST request and to expect in the response?

     1: JSON containing an OAuth bearer token Specify your authentication header in the request. To run the pipeline from the REST endpoint, you need an OAuth2 Bearer-type authentication header.
     
     2: JSON containing the experiment name
     Add a JSON payload object that has the experiment name.


111. ### You start by configuring a k parameter as the number of splits.

      Setting K = n (the number of observations) yields n-fold and is called leave-one out cross-validation (LOO), This is why the usual choice is K=5 or 10.

112. ### The model must be optimized for area under the received operating characteristic curve performance metric, averaged for each class

     Step 1:Create and select a new dataset by uploading he command-delimited file of penguin data.

     Step 2: Select the Classification task type.

     Step 3: Set the Primary metric configuration setting to Accuracy

113. ### Choose the one which has lower training and validation error and also the closest match.
     Minimize variance (difference between validation error and train error).

114. ### The training dataset that you are using is highly unbalanced. You need to evaluate the classification model.  Which primary metric should you use?
     AUC_weighted is a Classification metric.

     Note: AUC is the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. Weighted is the arithmetic mean of the score for each class, weighted by the number of true instances in each class.

     normalized_mean_absolute_error is a regression metric, not a classification metric.

     normalized_root_mean_squared_error is a regression metric, not a classification metric.

115. ### You publish the model as a real-time service on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) inference compute cluster

     The URL of the endpoint.

     The key for the endpoint.

116. ### You plan to use automated machine learning to create a time-series model that predicts temperature over the next seven days.

     1: You choose Forecasting

     Task: The type of task to run. Values can be 'classification', 'regression', or 'forecasting' depending on the type of automated ML problem to solve.

      2: You select Temperature
     The training data to be used within the experiment. It should contain both training features and a label column (optionally a sample weights column).

      3: You choose Observation_time
     time_column_name: The name of the time column. This parameter is required when forecasting to specify the datetime column in the input data used for building the time series and inferring its frequency. This setting is being deprecated. Please use forecasting_parameters instead.

      4: You select 7 - "predicts temperature over the next seven days"
     max_horizon: The desired maximum forecast horizon in units of time-series frequency. The default value is 1.
     Units are based on the time interval of your training data, e.g., monthly, weekly that the forecaster should predict out. When task type is forecasting, this parameter is required.

      5: You select 50 models - "For the initial round of training, you want to train a maximum of 50 different models

{:start="118"}
118. ### The task will attempt to find the best performing model based on a metric named accuracy.

     best_model = automl_run.get_output()

119. ### You need to configure the sampling method for the Hyperdrive experiment.

     Bayesian sampling is based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm and makes intelligent choices on the hyperparameter values to sample next. It picks the sample based on how the previous samples performed, such that the new sample improves the reported primary metric. Bayesian sampling does not support any early termination policy

     Random sampling.

120. ### Which two early termination policies should you use?

     The Median Stopping policy computes running averages across all runs and cancels runs whose best performance is worse than the median of the running averages.
     If no policy is specified, the hyperparameter tuning service will let all training runs execute to completion.


121. ### You need to troubleshoot the failed experiment. What are two possible ways to achieve this goal?

     Use the get_details_with_logs() method of the run object to display the Â·
     experiment run logs.

     View the logs for the experiment run in Azure Machine Learning studio.

122. ### You create a tabular dataset containing data that you plan to use to create a classification model.

     Step 1: Create and start a Compute Instance
     To train and deploy models using Azure Machine Learning designer, you need compute on which to run the training process, test the model, and host the model in a deployed service.

     There are four kinds of compute resource you can create:

     Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.

     Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.

     Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.

     Attached Compute: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.

     Step 2: Create and run a training pipeline.. After you've used data transformations to prepare the data, you can use it to train a machine learning model. Create and run a training pipeline 

     Step 3: Create and run a real-time inference pipeline After creating and running a pipeline to train the model, you need a second pipeline that performs the same data transformations for new data, and then uses the trained model to inference (in other words, predict) label values based on its features. This pipeline will form the basis for a predictive service that you can publish for

123. ### You need to configure the Tune Model Hyperparameters module. Which two values should you use?

     Number of learning iterations

     Hidden layer specification

124. ### You must use MLflow as the logging package for tracking metrics generated in the experiment.

     1: import mlflow -
     Import the mlflow and Workspace classes to access MLflow's tracking URI and configure your workspace.
     
     2: mlflow.start_run()
     Set the MLflow experiment name with set_experiment() and start your training run with start_run().
     
     3: mlflow.log_metric(' ..')
     Use log_metric() to activate the MLflow logging API and begin logging your training run metrics.
     
     4: mlflow.end_run()

{:start="139"}
139. ### Which parameter sweep mode should you use?-

     Maximum number of runs on random grid: This option also controls the number of iterations over a random sampling of parameter values, but the values are not generated randomly from the specified range; instead, a matrix is created of all possible combinations of parameter values and a random sampling is taken over the matrix. This method is more efficient and less prone to regional oversampling or undersampling.

140. ### You need to identify whether the classification model is overfitted.

     The training loss decreases while the validation loss increases when training the Â·
     model.

141. ### You need to configure the run to ensure that the environment includes the required packages for model training. You have instantiated a variable named aml- compute that references the target compute cluster.

     ```
     sk_est = Estimator(source_directory='./my-sklearn-proj', script_params=script_params,
     compute_target=compute_target,
     entry_script='train.py',
     conda_packages=['scikit-learn'])
     ```

     {:start="142"}

142. ### You are performing clustering by using the K-means algorithm. You need to define the possible termination conditions

     Centroids do not change between iterations.

     The residual sum of squares (RSS) falls below a threshold.

     A fixed number of iterations is executed.

143. ### You need to evaluate the C-Support Vector classification code. Which evaluation statement should you use?

     1: Automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
     The  balanced   mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y)).

     2: Penalty parameter

144. ### You need to build and train the machine learning model to learn the sequence of the textual content.
     Which type of neural network should you use?

     To translate a corpus of English text to French, we need to build a recurrent neural network (RNN).
     Note: RNNs are designed to take sequences of text as inputs or return sequences of text as outputs, or both. They're called recurrent because the network's hidden layers have a loop in which the output and cell state from each time step become inputs at the next time step. This recurrence serves as a form of memory.

145. ### You create a binary classification model.
     You need to evaluate the model performance.
     Which two metrics can you use?

     Precision and accuracy.
     
     The evaluation metrics available for binary classification models are: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC.
     
146. ### You need to use Azure Machine Learning to find the combination of batch size and learning rate that results in the model with the lowest validation loss.
     What should you do?

     Run the script in an experiment based on a HyperDriveConfig object Â·
     Discussion

147. ### You need to ensure the pipeline runs automatically whenever the data in the folder changes.
     What should you do?

     Create a Schedule for the pipeline. Specify the datastore in the datastore Â·
     property, and the folder containing the training data in the path_on_datastore property

     as_download()
     as_mount()

152. ### You need to reference a Python class object from the SDK for the statement.
     Which class object should you use?

     A run represents a single trial of an experiment. Runs are used to monitor the asynchronous execution of a trial, log metrics and store output of
     the trial, and to analyze results and access artifacts generated by the trial.

     pipeline_run1 = Experiment(ws, 'Compare_Models_Exp').submit(pipeline1)

     

156. ### The Workspace.get method loads an existing workspace without using configuration files. ws = Workspace.get(name="myworkspace", subscription_id='<azure-subscription-id>', resource_group='myresourcegroup') 
	 MLflow Tracking with Azure Machine Learning lets you store the logged metrics and artifacts from your local runs into your Azure Machine
     Learning workspace.
	
     The get_mlflow_tracking_uri() method assigns a unique tracking URI address to the workspace, ws, and set_tracking_uri() points the MLflow
     tracking URI to that address.

     In Deep Learning, epoch means the total dataset is passed forward and backward in a neural network once.

     2: predictions-dataset -
     Target dataset - usually model input data - is compared over time to your baseline dataset. This comparison means that your target dataset
     must have a timestamp column specified.
     The monitor will compare the baseline and target datasets.

159. ### You need to write code to define a ScriptRunConfig object for the experiment and pass the ds dataset as an argument.

     If you have structured data not yet registered as a dataset, create a TabularDataset and use it directly in your training script for your local or
     remote experiment.
     To load the TabularDataset to pandas DataFrame
     df = dataset.to_pandas_dataframe()

160. ### You need to verify that the web service returns predictions in the expected JSON format when a valid REST request is submitted. Which compute resources should you use?

     1: ds-workstation notebook VM
     An authenticated connection must not be required for testing. On a Microsoft Azure virtual machine (VM), including a Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM), you create local user accounts while provisioning the VM. Users then authenticate to the VM by using these credentials.

     2: gpu-compute cluster -
     Image classification is well suited for GPU compute clusters

175. ### You need to use the Python SDK in the notebook to determine the events that occurred during service deployment an initialization.

     The first step in debugging errors is to get your deployment logs. In Python:
     service.get_logs()

176. ### You need to ensure that every step in the pipeline is run, even if the parameters and contents of the source directory have not changed since the previous run.

     Set the regenerate_outputs property of the pipeline to True.

     Set the allow_reuse property of each step in the pipeline to False.Â·

177. ### You are ready to deploy the model as a real-time web service.

     2: run()

183. ### You need to deploy the model as an Azure Machine Learning real-time web service endpoint on compute that can dynamically scale up and down to support demand.
     Which deployment compute option should you use?

     Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance
     Azure Machine Learning compute cluster is a managed-compute infrastructure that allows you to easily create a single or multi-node compute.

184. ### You create a real-time inference pipeline from the training pipeline. You observe that the schema for the generated web service input is based on the dataset and includes the label column that the model predicts. Client applications that use the service must not be required to submit this
     value.

     Add a Select Columns in Dataset module to the inference pipeline after the dataset and use it to select all columns other than the label.

185. ### You must deploy the real-time inference pipeline as a web service.

200. ### You are creating a model to predict the price of a student's artwork depending on the following variables: the student's length of education, degree type, and art form.
     You start by creating a linear regression model. You need to evaluate the linear regression model.

     Solution: Use the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Absolute Error, Relative Absolute Error, Relative Squared Error, and the Coefficient of Determination.

     The following metrics are reported for evaluating regression models. When you compare models, they are ranked by the metric you select for evaluation. Mean absolute error (MAE) measures how close the predictions are to the actual outcomes; thus, a lower score is better.
     Root mean squared error (RMSE) creates a single value that summarizes the error in the model.

201. ### You are creating a model to predict the price of a student's artwork depending on the following variables: the student's length of education, degree type, and art form.
     You start by creating a linear regression model. You need to evaluate the linear regression model. Solution: Use the following metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC.
     Does the solution meet the goal?

     Those are metrics for evaluating classification models, instead use: Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Absolute Error, Relative Absolute Error, Relative Squared
     Error, and the Coefficient of Determination.

202. ### You are creating a model to predict the price of a student's artwork depending on the following variables: the student's length of education, degree type, and art form.
     You start by creating a linear regression model. You need to evaluate the linear regression model. Solution: Use the following metrics: Relative Squared Error, Coefficient of Determination, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC.

     Relative Squared Error, Coefficient of Determination are good metrics to evaluate the linear regression model, but the others are metrics for classification models.

203. ### You are a data scientist creating a linear regression model. You need to determine how closely the data fits the regression line. Which metric should you review?
     Coefficient of determination, often referred to as R2, represents the predictive power of the model as a value between 0 and 1. Zero means the model is random

204. You are creating a binary classification by using a two-class logistic regression model.
     You need to evaluate the model results for imbalance.
     Which evaluation metric should you use?

     AUC Curve -One can inspect the true positive rate vs. the false positive rate in the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) value. The closer this curve is to the upper left corner; the better the classifier's performance is (that is maximizing the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate). Curves that are close to the diagonal of the plot, result from classifiers that tend to make predictions that are close to random guessing.
     Â·

205. ### You are developing a linear regression model in Azure Machine Learning Studio. You run an experiment to compare different algorithms. The following image displays the results dataset output:

     1: Boosted Decision Tree Regression
     Mean absolute error (MAE) measures how close the predictions are to the actual outcomes; thus, a lower score is better.
     
	 2:Online Gradient Descent: If you want the algorithm to find the best parameters for you, set Create trainer mode option to Parameter Range. You can then specify multiple values for the algorithm to try.

206. ###  You need to select the bias and variance properties of the model with varying tree depth values.

     ###  Which properties should you select for each tree depth? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area

     In decision trees, the depth of the tree determines the variance. A complicated decision tree (e.g. deep) has low bias and high variance. Note: In statistics and machine learning, the bias  "variance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models with a lower bias in parameter estimation have a higher variance of the parameter estimates across samples, and vice versa. Increasing the bias will decrease the variance. Increasing the variance will decrease the bias.

207. ### You need to identify a parameter set for the new model using Azure Machine Learning Studio. Which module you should use for each step? To answer, drag the appropriate modules to the correct steps. Each module may be used once or more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

     2: Partition and Sample.
	
     3: Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree.
	
     4: Tune Model Hyperparameters

208. ### You are analyzing the asymmetry in a statistical distribution. The following image contains two density curves that show the probability distribution of two datasets.

     1: Positive skew -
     Positive skew values means the distribution is skewed to the right.

     2: Negative skew -
     Negative skewness values mean the distribution is skewed to the left.

209. ### The CNN model you build shows signs of overfitting. You need to reduce overfitting and converge the model to an optimal fit. Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents a complete solution

     Add L1/L2 regularization.

     Reduce the amount of training data.

      Weight regularization provides an approach to reduce the overfitting of a deep learning neural network model on the training data and improve the performance of the model on new data, such as the holdout test set. Keras provides a weight regularization API that allows you to add a penalty for weight size to the loss function.

      Three different regularizer instances are provided; they are:

      L1: Sum of the absolute weights.

      L2: Sum of the squared weights.

      L1L2: Sum of the absolute and the squared weights.

      D: Because a fully connected layer occupies most of the parameters, it is prone to overfitting. One method to reduce overfitting is dropout. At each training stage, individual nodes are either "dropped out" of the net with probability 1-p or kept with probability p, so that a reduced network is left; incoming and outgoing edges to a dropped-out node are also removed.
      By avoiding training all nodes on all training data, dropout decreases overfitting.

     Relative Expression Split: Use this option whenever you want to apply a condition to a number column. The number could be a date/time field, a
     column containing age or dollar amounts, or even a percentage. For example, you might want to divide your data set depending on the cost of
     the items, group people by age ranges, or separate data by a calendar date.

267. ### Set the threshold to 0.5 and retrain if weighted Kappa deviates +/- 5% from 0.45.

268. You need to replace the missing data in the AccessibilityToHighway columns.
     How should you configure the Clean Missing Data module?

     1: Replace using MICE

     Replace using MICE: For each missing value, this option assigns a new value, which is calculated by using a method described in the statistical
     literature as
     "Multivariate Imputation using Chained Equations" or "Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations". With a multiple imputation method, each
     variable with missing data is modeled conditionally using the other variables in the data before filling in the missing values.
     Scenario: The AccessibilityToHighway column in both datasets contains missing values. The missing data must be replaced with new data so
     that it is modeled conditionally using the other variables in the data before filling in the missing values.

     2: Propagate

     Cols with all missing values indicate if columns of all missing values should be preserved in the output.

269. ### You need to produce a visualization for the diagnostic test evaluation according to the data visualization requirements. Which three modules should you recommend be used in sequence?
     Step 1: Sweep Clustering

     Start by using the "Tune Model Hyperparameters" module to select the best sets of parameters for each of the models we're considering.
     One of the interesting things about the "Tune Model Hyperparameters" module is that it not only outputs the results from the Tuning, it also
     outputs the Trained
     Model.
     
     Step 2: Train Model

     Step 3: Evaluate Model


271. ### You are a data scientist for Fabrikam Residences, a company specializing in quality private and commercial property in the United States.
     Fabrikam Residences is considering expanding into Europe and has asked you to investigate prices for private residences in major European
     cities.

     1: Floating point -
     Need floating point for Median values.
     Scenario: An initial investigation shows that the datasets are identical in structure apart from the MedianValue column. The smaller Paris
     dataset contains the
     MedianValue in text format, whereas the larger London dataset contains the MedianValue in numerical format.

272. ### You use Azure Machine Learning Studio to measure the median value of properties. You produce a regression model to predict property prices byusing the

     Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression modules.
     1: 500 
     For Random seed, type a value to use as seed for randomization. If you specify 0 (the default), a number is generated based on the system
     clock.

     A seed value is optional, but you should provide a value if you want reproducibility across runs of the same experiment.
     Here we must replicate the findings.
     
     2: Mean Absolute Error -

273. ### Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a mon otonic function.

     Note: Both Spearman's and Kendall's can be formulated as special cases of a more general correlation coefficient, and they are both appropriate
     in this scenario.

     Scenario: The MedianValue and AvgRoomsInHouse columns both hold data in numeric format. You need to select a feature selection algorithm
     to analyze the relationship between the two columns in more detail.
     Incorrect Answers:

274. ### An initial investigation shows that the datasets are identical in structure apart from the MedianValue column. The smaller Paris dataset contains the MedianValue in text format, whereas the larger London dataset contains the MedianValue in numerical format.

     1: Accuracy -
     Scenario: You want to configure hyperparameters in the model learning process to speed the learning phase by using hyperparameters. In
     addition, this configuration should cancel the lowest performing runs at each evaluation interval, thereby directing effort and resources towards
     models that are more likely to be successful.

     2: R-Squared
     
275. ### a) What is Mutual Information?
     The mutual information score is particularly useful in feature selection because it maximizes the mutual information between the joint
     distribution and target variables in datasets with many dimensions.

     ### b) What is MedianValue?
     MedianValue is the feature column, , it is the predictor of the dataset.
     Scenario: The MedianValue and AvgRoomsinHouse columns both hold data in numeric format. You need to select a feature selection algorithm
     to analyze the relationship between the two columns in more detail.

276. ### What is Kendall rank ?
     
	 In statistics, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, commonly referred to as Kendall's tau coefficient (after the Greek letter  ,,), is a statistic
     used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities.
     It is a supported methz of the Azure Machine Learning Feature selection.
     Note: Both Spearman's and Kendall's can be formulated as special cases of a more general correlation coefficient, and they are both appropriate
     in this scenario.

     Scenario: The MedianValue and AvgRoomsInHouse columns both hold data in numeric format. You need to select a feature selection algorithm
     to analyze the relationship between the two columns in more detail.

277. ### You need to implement an early stopping criterion on models that provides savings without terminating promising jobs.
     
	 Truncation selection cancels a given percentage of lowest performing runs at each evaluation interval. Runs are compared based on their
     performance on the primary metric and the lowest X% are terminated.
     
	 Example:
     from azureml.train.hyperdrive import TruncationSelectionPolicy early_termination_policy = TruncationSelectionPolicy(evaluation_interval=1,
     truncation_percentage=20, delay_evaluation=5)

     Bandit is a termination policy based on slack factor/slack amount and evaluation interval. The policy early terminates any runs where the
     primary metric is not within the specified slack factor / slack amount with respect to the best performing training run.
     
	 Example:
     from azureml.train.hyperdrive import BanditPolicy

278. ### You must configure hyperparameters in the model learning process to speed the learning phase. In addition, this configuration should cancel the lowest performing runs at each evaluation interval, thereby directing effort and resources towards models that are more likely to be successful.
     
	  Step 1: from azureml.train.hyperdrive
     
	  Step 2: Import TruncationCelectionPolicy
      Truncation selection cancels a given percentage of lowest performing runs at each evaluation interval. Runs are compared based on their
      performance on the primary metric and the lowest X% are terminated.
     
	  Step 3: early_terminiation_policy = TruncationSelectionPolicy..
     
	  Example:
      from azureml.train.hyperdrive import TruncationSelectionPolicy early_termination_policy = TruncationSelectionPolicy(evaluation_interval=1,
      truncation_percentage=20, delay_evaluation=5)
      In this example, the early termination policy is applied at every interval starting at evaluation interval 5. A run will be terminated at interval 5 if
      its performance at interval 5 is in the lowest 20% of performance of all runs at interval 5.



279. ### You must set up the experiment to cross-validate the Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression modules to evaluate performance. In each case, the predictor of the dataset is the column named MedianValue. You must ensure that the datatype of the MedianValue column of the Paris dataset matches the structure of the London dataset. You must prioritize the columns of data for predicting the outcome. You must use non-parametric statistics to measure relationships.You must use a feature selection algorithm to analyze the relationship between the MedianValue and AvgRoomsInHouse columns.
     
	 Step 1: Augment the data -
	
     Scenario: Columns in each dataset contain missing and null values. The datasets also contain many outliers.
     
	 Step 2: Add the Bayesian Linear Regression module.
     Scenario: You produce a regression model to predict property prices by using the Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression modules.
     
	 Step 3: Configure the regularization weight.
     
	 Regularization typically is used to avoid overfitting. For example, in L2 regularization weight, type the value to use as the weight for L2
     regularization. We recommend that you use a non-zero value to avoid overfitting.
     
	 Scenario:
     Model fit: The model shows signs of overfitting. You need to produce a more refined regression model that reduces the overfitting.
     Incorrect Answers:
     
	 Multiclass Decision Jungle module:
     Decision jungles are a recent extension to decision forests. A decision jungle consists of an ensemble of decision directed acyclic graphs
     (DAGs).
     
	 L-BFGS:
     L-BFGS stands for "limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno". It can be found in the wwo-Class Logistic Regression module, which is
     used to create a logistic regression model that can be used to predict two (and only two) outcomes.
