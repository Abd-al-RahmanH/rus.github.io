Hello everyone, today we are going to  create an **EC2 Server** with **GPU** and Install **CUDA** and **cuDNN** and create your private AMI.

An EC2 instance, short for Elastic Compute Cloud instance, is a virtual server provided by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It allows users to rent virtual machines in the cloud to run their applications and services. EC2 instances offer a wide range of benefits, including scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

When it comes to using EC2 instances with **GPUs** (Graphics Processing Units), there are several advantages. GPUs are highly specialized processors designed to handle complex mathematical computations efficiently. By utilizing GPUs in EC2 instances, users can accelerate tasks that require heavy parallel processing, such as machine learning, data analysis, and scientific simulations.

The inclusion of GPUs in EC2 instances enables faster and more efficient processing of graphics-intensive workloads. This can lead to significant performance improvements, reduced processing time, and enhanced capabilities for applications that heavily rely on graphical processing power.

In summary, leveraging EC2 instances with GPUs provides users with the ability to harness the power of specialized processors, enabling them to tackle computationally demanding tasks more effectively and efficiently.

# Create EC2 Instance with GPU

First we need to login to our AWS Account

[AWS Account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin)

Then go to your menu and click Services Quotas

![image-20230919204207495](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20230919204207495.png)

and select `All G and VT Spot Instances Requests` and click **Request increase account level**  and choose **4** otherwise wont towk. Because the cheaper GPU currently on AWS has 4 vcps and if yo request 1, you wont launch the instance. 

![image-20230919220441109](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20230919220441109.png)

After few hours maximum on day, will be available the spot instances for P4 instances. In ordert 

If you want use on demand you can use `Running on Demand G and VT instances.`  and agiain you request 4.

## Creation of the Security Group

Since our Chatbot will use **Streamlit**,  normally runs on port **8501** or **850*** we will have to create a new firewall run to allow a custom port for our streamlit app.

On the menu bar we find **Security Groups**

![r](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20230919211023354.png)

We open the Feature of EC2 and we click 	 **Create Security Group**

 So at the configure security group we will a custom tcp port by clicking on the **ADD RULE.** Then select **Custom TCP Port .** In the port range you will then change it to **8501**, **8888**, and **22**. Finally you will select **anywhere** in the sources section. and  for outbound keep the default values and click create security group.

For production for sure you can remove the SSH and the Jupyter Notebook ports.

## Launch EC2 Instance

We go to EC2 and we create an instance **Worker** and we choose **Ubuntu 22.04** with server **g4dn.xlarge**

![image-20231002214752315](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231002214752315.png)



we create a private key, **you download this key**  because we will  use later  and for security group select existing security group ,  **Streamlit**,

![image-20231002214902234](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231002214902234.png)

Then we require to add additional storage space to our Virtual Instance, we choose 100gb

![image-20231002215129289](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231002215129289.png)



If we want to save money , in **Advanced details** we must put **spot.** 

![image-20230919214933335](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20230919214933335.png)

and we keep all the reamaining settings as default and click launch

![image-20231002215435058](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231002215435058.png)

Be **aware** that now time is money. So **do not forget to delete your instance** after you finish this demo.

Now the Instance is initializing , we wait few minutes and then we click on **Connect**

then we select the **SSH Client**

![image-20231002220110688](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231002220110688.png)



Then we have to open our terminal, then go where you downloaded your private key

1. Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.

2. ```
   chmod 400 MyPrivateKey.pem
   ```

3. Connect to your instance using its Public DNS for example:

```
 ssh -i "MyPrivateKey.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-234-217-147.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

and you will got something like

## Transferring Files Using SCP 

Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) is a means of securely transferring computer files between a local and a remote host or between two remote hosts. It’s based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

To copy a file from your local system to your EC2 instance, use the following command:

```bash
scp -i "MyPrivateKey.pem" C:\Users\Downloads\cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2204-8.9.5.29_1.0-1_amd64.deb  ubuntu@ec2-3-234-217-147.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu

```

and you can check if was uploaded

# Create an AMI from an Amazon EC2 Instance

In ordering to save our EC2 Instance Setup that we have done before  got to **Amazon EC2 Instances** view, you can create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) from either running or stopped instances. 

*To create an AMI from an instance*

1. Right-click the instance you want to use as the basis for your AMI, and choose **Create Image** from the context menu.

   ![image-20231002231900549](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231002231900549.png)

   **Create Image** context menu

2. In the **Create Image** dialog box, type a unique name and description, and then choose **Create Image**. By default, Amazon EC2 shuts down the instance, takes snapshots of any attached volumes, creates and registers the AMI, and then reboots the instance. Choose **No reboot**if you don't want your instance to be shut down.

   

   ###### Warning

   If you choose **No reboot**, we can't guarantee the file system integrity of the created image.

   ![image-20231002232421856](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231002232421856.png)

   **Create Image** dialog box

It may take a few minutes for the AMI to be created. After it is created, it will appear in the **AMIs** view in AWS Explorer. To display this view, double-click the **Amazon EC2 | AMIs** node in AWS Explorer. To see your AMIs, from the **Viewing** drop-down list, choose **Owned By Me**. You may need to choose **Refresh** to see your AMI. When the AMI first appears, it may be in a pending state, but after a few moments, it transitions to an available state.

Now you can **Terminate your Instance** and next time you can load your new GPU instance 

![image-20231003000820052](../assets/images/posts/2023-01-08-How-to-Install-CUDA-and-cuDNN-on-Ubuntu-on-an-EC2-Instance-with-GPU/image-20231003000820052.png)

Remember thant the GPU instances are expensive

**Congratulations!** You have created an **EC2 instance** with **GPU** and installed **CUDA** and **AMI**.
